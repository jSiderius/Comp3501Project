Joshua Siderius 101145002
COMP 3501 Assignment 4

Changes: 

lit_fp.glsl:
  - Made changes as per the assignment specs, switched to Phong shading and added uniforms etc
  - The light source is rendered based on an extremely simple shader in sun_fp.glsl it is set up in the game file
  - The uniforms are passed in the SceneNode file in the SetupShader function
  - The light uniform is based on a the same parametric path as the rendered sun object, this is a lazy approach and I could restructure the code to accomadate them being the same object, but seing as this is not a focal point of the project and there is no specific indication to do otherwise I left it 

game.cpp:
  - Changes to MainLoop SetupScene and SetupResources accordingly to the instructions

procedural_fp.glsl:
  - Took a modulo approach to render the checker board
  - Made a green & red color scheme, set up the red half to oscelate brightness

combined_fp.glsl:
  - Added shader as a combination of the 2 previous shaders
